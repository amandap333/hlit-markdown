# Step Two

Have students work in teams of 3 to look at 3 websites that focus on CBD. Students should be able to scan these websites in about 5 minutes (or less) and should not spend time reading all the text on these sites. The goal of this step is for students to think about how they currently judge a website that they see and give their first impressions about the quality of a site. After they have a chance to complete this step, hold a brief class discussion to draw out student ideas.
- hat features (color, appealing graphics, lots of text, and so forth) do students think make one website better than others? 

At this point, elicit studentsâ€™ current ideas but do not correct any preconceptions they have. You may need to reinforce that the question posed. The question asks about whether science and medicine would support the use of CBD for chronic pain relief. If students were considering a different question, answers would likely be different. Students will return to these CBD websites at several points during the module as they learn more about strategies for evaluating information from websites and other media.
