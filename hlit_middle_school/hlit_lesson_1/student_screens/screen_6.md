# Step Six

Work with your teammates to look at 3 different websites to see if they meet the criteria on the rubric. At this point, you do not need to read all the information on the websites. Instead, look for whether the features are present or not.

Take these steps as you look at each website:
1. Locate 8 information icons (**I**) next to website features.
2. Click on the icon to read the information about the website feature.
3. Decide whether each feature is present on the website. 
4. Decide whether each icon relates to one of the criteria on your rubric. Record your answers in the “Website feature and quality” column on your rubric. Use this column to keep track of how well the website meets each criterium. 
  - If the feature is present, place a +sign in this column.
  - If the feature is not present (or not done well), you can place a – sign in this column.
  - If you are not sure whether this feature is met or you do not think it is applicable, you can place a 0 in this column. 
5. In the last column, write a brief explanation for why you think the website does or does not meet the criteria. In other words, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each website for the listed criteria. 

Leave the score column blank for now. You will assign a score later.

Click the buttons below to go to the different websites.
### <div align="center">[website 1]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[website 2]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[website 3]()</div>

When you are done evaluating your website, work with your teammates to compare the 3 sites. Decide what are the strongest and weakest parts of the different sites.
