# Step Nine

Now that you have developed skills to assess website features, think back to the question about CBD that you considered at the start of this lesson: 

“Is CBD use to relieve pain supported by science and medicine?”

You will need 3 copies of the rubric—one for each of the CBD websites. Use the criteria on your rubric to score each of the CBD websites.

Only do the first category, “Lesson 1 Website Quality Initial Screen,” now.

**Make sure you save all the rubrics.** You will need them again in later lessons. You may want to save them with your name and the name or number of the CBD website. For example, myname-CBD1.

### <div align="center">[Rubric]()</div>

### <div align="center">[CBD website 1]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CBD website 2]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CBD website 3]()</div>

Keep the following ideas in mind:
- Your scores do not need to match those of your teammates. The important part is that you can give a reason for your score. 
- You can change your score at any time if you think the evidence supports a change.
