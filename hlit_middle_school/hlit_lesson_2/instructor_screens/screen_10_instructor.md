**Optional Wrap-Up Discussion Questions**

The following questions may be interesting for students to consider now that they have considered the accuracy of internet sites. You can allow students to choose which question they are interested in or you could assign students to a question. 

1. Suppose you hear a report on an evening news program that begins, “Researchers published findings from a new study showing that a new treatment can reduce complications of heart disease.”
  - Do you think people should get this new treatment immediately?
  - What questions would you want to ask about the study before making a decision about the information?

*It can be easy for some people to get excited when they hear about a potential medical breakthrough or advancement. However, many times these news reports are talking about small studies that need much more work before the results can be validated and incorporated in medical treatments. Questions that you should ask when hearing a headline such as this one might include these:
- How large was the study?
- Was the study done with humans or animals?
- What percentage of people in the study benefited from the treatment?
- How long did the study go on?
- How do the results of this study compare with other studies?
- Were there any negative outcomes to this study?

The questions that students list are likely to reflect issues related to good experimental design. This is an opportunity also to discuss how scientific studies need to be replicated as part of determining whether the findings hold up and that scientists become more confident in their findings both when studies are repeated with similar results and when the studies are repeated with large sample sizes and a diverse group of participants.*

2. Suppose you see a commercial on TV that says the product has been clinically tested. Do you think this means the same thing as going through a clinical trial? 

*The term “clinically tested” does not have a standardized meaning. Companies can use this to refer to any type of testing they may have done. When this is said, they may be referring to any studies they have conducted themselves (rather than by an impartial, unbiased group of scientists). From this lesson, students should remember that not all clinical trials are done well. The website clinicaltrials.gov is a place where people can look for more information.*

3. Some social media sites use blue checkmarks or ticks to verify accounts. What does it mean to be verified? What does it tell you (or not tell you) about the site and the information it contains?

*Students may need to do some research to answer this one. A blue tick or checkmark on social media (such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or others) indicates the account holder has been verified. An account may be verified if it is determined to be an account of public interest. Typically, this includes accounts maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas. A verified badge does not imply an endorsement by the social media platform. This verification was intended to help readers know if they are looking at the actual account of the person of public interest or of someone fraudulent. It does not, however, give information about accuracy of information on that site. Before people make judgments based on this type of symbol, they should know what it stands for and how it is obtained. It is also important to recognize that policies and procedures for verifying accounts can change. For example, in 2017, Twitter suspended its verification program after a blue check was granted to the organizer of a white supremacist rally. Although it was only verified because it was potentially of public interest, the blue checkmark created problems. People incorrectly thought that it was a mark of endorsement or prestige, which was not Twitter’s intent. According to recent reports, Twitter is considering revamping the verification process with new criteria.
