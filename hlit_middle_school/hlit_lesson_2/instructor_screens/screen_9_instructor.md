# Step Nine

In this step, students use their rubrics to reexamine the 3 CBD sites they evaluated in Lesson 1. (In Lesson 1, they evaluated web features. Now they will evaluate the accuracy of information on the sites using their newly expanded rubric.)

Inform students whether to work individually or in teams. 

Students should consider the following questions as they evaluate the CBD sites for accuracy and be prepared for a class discussion.
- Did your opinion change about the quality of each of the websites? 
- What are the strengths or weaknesses of each site with respect to the accuracy of information? 
- Do you think you will question the accuracy of information on websites differently in the future? How will that affect your use of the internet?

After students have a chance to complete this section of their rubrics, discuss any questions they may have about using their rubrics to score the accuracy of information.
