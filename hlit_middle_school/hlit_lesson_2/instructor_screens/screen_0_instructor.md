# Step Zero

**Teacher only screen:** Before, instructing students to log on and start the lesson on the website, remind them of what they did in Lesson 1. Lead a brief discussion that includes guiding questions such as these:
- In Lesson 1, you considered features of websites that helped you make quick judgments as to their quality. But can you really know whether a website is good just by scanning those features? 
- What else do you need to consider? *(Hopefully, students will suggest thinking about accuracy of information.)*

Continue the discussion by asking students, “How many results do you get when you search for things on the web?” *(Student responses will vary.)*

Ask students how many “hits” they might get if they do a Google search using the word “cancer” as a search term. After students make their guesses, reveal that entering the word “cancer” results in about 4,160,000,000 results. If time allows, you can do this search with students so they can see the number of hits that come up from the search. 

Next ask students, “A search can give a lot of results. How might we get a lower number of hits when we search?” If students do not suggest it, prompt them to think about making the search more specific. For example, instead of “cancer,” you could search for a specific type of cancer (e.g., brain cancer), add more search terms (brain cancer and cell phones), or ask a question that relates to a specific cause of cancer (e.g., Do cell phones increase a person’s risk for brain cancer?). Again, if time permits, you can do these searches with the class and allow them to see how the refined search terms affect the number of hits. 

**NOTE TO TEACHERS:** Keep the discussion focused and brief. The goal is simply to get students to recognize the vast amount of information available on the internet as an introduction to this lesson about accuracy of information.
