# Step Eight

Have students retrieve the copies of the rubrics that they started using in Lesson 1The goal is for students to develop their own rubric and to start making decisions about what is important to include. The rubric lists two criteria for the Lesson 2 category to help students get started.

Hold a class discussion to help guide students’ writing of criteria. The following points should be helpful.
- Encourage students to write statements that can be answered either yes or no. 
- When writing criteria for their rubrics, ask students to phrase their statements in a way that a “yes” or “agree” answer is the desired outcome. This will ensure that for all statements, the applicable score would be the highest score. Scoring would be compromised if the desired outcomes for all questions was a 5 rather than some being a 5 and others a 1.
- Tell students that it is OK if they do not fill every row on the rubric. Alternatively, they can add lines if they have more criteria than lines currently on the rubric. 


Students should use what they have learned from the readings about clinical trials or their analysis of clinical trials to help them develop rubric criteria. Potential entries on the rubric related to accuracy of information include the following: 
- The information or claim is based on recent scientific studies.
- The treatment, medication, or intervention has been appropriately tested (through well-designed clinical trials).
- Information is provided about whom the intervention applies to (e.g., men, women, racial/ethnic groups, ages).
- Any conflict-of-interest or financial incentive is disclosed.

Encourage the students to try to come up with criteria on their own or with a partner. However, if you feel that students are not yet ready for this challenge, work through ideas for criteria as a class and then have students add the criteria to their rubrics. (Students will also add to the rubric in the following lessons.) 

You may also want to remind students that they are developing this rubric as a tool to give to someone else who does not know how to evaluate a website. 

Remind students (both in this lesson and later) to view the rubric as something that is dynamic and can be changed later if they think of other things to add or decide that something should be revised.
