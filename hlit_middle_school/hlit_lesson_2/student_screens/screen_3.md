# Step Three

Work in a team of 2â€“3 students for this step. In your notebook, create a table with two columns labeled with these headings:

### <div align="center">[Accurate]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Inaccurate]()</div>

<!-- **needs links -->

You will be looking at a website for a diet supplement to help people lose weight. As you look through the website, try to find words or phrases that might make you think the information is likely to be accurate or inaccurate. Record those words or phrases in the table in your notebook. 

### <div align="center">[Green coffee bean extract website]()</div>
