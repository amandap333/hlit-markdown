This step is optional. Instruct your students to either do this step or to skip it. Alternatively, you can inform students about what the FTC does and display one of the examples to show to the class. They may find it interesting to see an example of what the FTC responds to. 

The links take students to examples on the FTC website of how the agency has dealt with products for which the advertising has been deceptive or includes unsubstantiated scientific claims. You can let students choose one of these or you can assign an example to each student. Students do not need to learn the details of these cases.

The three examples each represent a different type of problem with the product involved, but a commonality is that the marketing involves unsubstantiated claims.

The FTC called for the manufacturer to cease these claims.
