# Step 6

In this step, students learn that ads for prescription medications are regulated by the FDA and that companies must include a balance of benefits and risks in their advertisements for these medications. The goal of this exercise is not necessarily for students to memorize all the required elements of an advertisement for a medication but rather to learn what to look for in an ad and to recognize that different types of medications have different requirements.
