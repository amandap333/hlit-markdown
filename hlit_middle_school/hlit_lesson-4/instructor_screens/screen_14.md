# Step 14

Have students get their rubrics that they have been working with. Their goal is to add criteria to the rubric that relate to benefits and risks. Encourage them to think about what they learned in the lesson and to discuss their ideas with their teammates. 

If students need help getting started, you can remind them that they learned about benefits. Prompt them to write a statement along the lines of "The information clearly describes the benefits of the product or treatment." 

After students have time to write statements in their rubrics, hold a class discussion so they can share their ideas. The following are some ideas that students can include on their rubrics. 

- The benefits of the treatment, medication, or intervention are clearly explained. 
- Information about potential risks (and the probability of these risks) is provided.
- The information being analyzed includes information about potential costs (e.g., monetary, time) that may be associated with the intervention.
- The information specifies how a given intervention, treatment, or medication compares with other possible interventions.
