# Step 15

Students revisit the CBD websites and use their rubrics to score those sites for benefits and risks. Students should be able to complete this in just a few minutes. As always, students should feel free to revise their rubrics or change their scores for any section of the rubric.  

**Optional:** If desired, use one of the following scenarios and questions to encourage discussion related to this lesson. You can either choose one scenario for the class or have different groups think about different scenarios.

1. People can choose whether they want to have a treatment for their health condition. How might their decision about treatment change if

- the disease is very serious and the side effects of the treatment are minor?
- the disease is very serious but the side effects can also be very serious?
- the disease is not very serious but the side effects are serious?
- the treatment only works well for 25 percent of people who have the disease?
- the chance of having a serious side effect is either 10 percent or less than 1 percent?
- the cost of the treatment is very low or very high?

_This scenario gives students the chance to think about factors that can affect decision-making. Students may discuss how different individuals may make different decisions based on other aspects of their lives. For issues such as these, there is not necessarily one answer that is right for everyone._

1. Ads for prescription drugs include information about side effects. Some of the side effects are minor and others are quite serious. How would people decide whether it is worth taking the drug and having the possible side effects? What questions should people ask if their doctor prescribes one of these medicines?

_People need to consider both the benefits and risks when deciding about treatment. Decisions may be made based on frequency or severity of side effects in comparison to the potential benefits. They may also want to consider whether other options are available. Decisions may also take into account the severity or duration of the health issue that they are trying to treat._
