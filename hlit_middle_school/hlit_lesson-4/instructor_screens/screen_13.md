# Step 13

To continue learning about risks and benefits, students will read about a case from a _Scientific American_ article. You can choose which option is appropriate for your students (the original article, the original article with highlighting capability, or a simplified reading). The main thing that students should look for are the types of risks involved. 

When students are finished, hold a class discussion to talk about risks and benefits. 

The main benefit the woman in the story wanted was an enhanced appearance. She encountered more risks than she wanted or expected, including the following:

- Procedure would not work as well as she wanted.
- Procedure had unwanted side effects (which is the result she got from the first procedure).
- She spent much more money than she expected when she had to have a second procedure to fix the problem caused by the first procedure. (She may not have money to do something else she wanted because she spent the money on a second procedure.) 
- She spent a lot of time getting the problem fixed. 
- There is a chance that the problem could recur in the future. 

You may also want to include some discussion about how the woman could have avoided being in this situation. Some ideas would be

- asking more questions before the procedure about its safety and risks,
- finding out how many times the doctor has done this procedure before, and
- asking about whether the medications or substances used in the procedure are approved for this use.
