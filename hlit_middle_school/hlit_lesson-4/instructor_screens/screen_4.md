# Screen 4

Students are introduced to the concepts of benefit and risk. Most students will not have much trouble understanding the idea of benefits. The idea of risk may be a bit more challenging for students. A common misconception is that risk implies that the negative consequence _will_ occur rather than it just being more likely. Other students may think that risks are only a problem if there is something already "wrong" with a person. Students will continue to think about risk and benefit during the remainder of the lesson.
