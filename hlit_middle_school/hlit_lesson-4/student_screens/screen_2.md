# Step 2
Are there any similarities in the type of information in the 2 ads? Do you notice any differences? Write your ideas in your science notebook. Watch the commercials again if you wish. 
At this point, students do not need to identify specific ideas or phrases in the ads that relate to positive or negative outcomes. They do not need to know specific information about the conditions mentioned in the ads or what the drugs do. They should simply compare the two ads and notice that one includes much more information than the other.<!--needs link(s)!-->
