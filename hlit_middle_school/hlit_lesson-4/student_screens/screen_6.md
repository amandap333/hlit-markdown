When companies advertise medicines, they need to follow certain rules set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The rules for prescription medications (medications that require a doctor's order) are stricter than those for medicines you can buy off the shelf. This is because prescription medications are more powerful and have a higher chance of hurting someone who does not take them correctly.
