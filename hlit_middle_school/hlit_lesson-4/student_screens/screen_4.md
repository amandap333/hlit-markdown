People take a medicine because they want it to help them. In other words, they want a **benefit** from taking the medicine. 

There is usually some chance that the medicine either will not help someone or could even cause side effects. Side effects are problems caused by the drug. These unwanted results are risks for the medicine. You can define **risk** as the chance that something unwanted will happen. 

It is important to remember that risk is just a higher chance of something happening. It does not mean that anyone who takes this medicine _will_ have these problems.

Think about a person walking on a sidewalk. There is a chance that the person might fall and hurt himself or herself. Most of the time the chance (risk) of falling is low. However, if the sidewalk is covered with ice, the person's risk of falling is higher. A higher risk does not mean that person will fall-it just means that the chance is greater.
