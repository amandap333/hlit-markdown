# Step 1

Imagine that you have just created a new product that helps people's health or well-being. With 2-3 other class members, create a list of the types of things that you would tell people about your product so you could sell a lot of it. Keep your list of ideas in your science notebook.

As you make your list, think about who you would tell about your product, what it does, why they should use it, and other general issues. 

Be ready to share your ideas in a class discussion.
