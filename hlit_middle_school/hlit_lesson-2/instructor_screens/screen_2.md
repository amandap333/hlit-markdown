In this step, students review the results of a study about accuracy of information on the internet. After students have seen the results, ask them if they are surprised by any of the data.

Some students may be surprised to learn that so much inaccurate information is found on the internet. Even though there are differences in the degree of accuracy among the different types of sources, the researchers did not find any type of source to be completely accurate. Some of the inaccuracies are due to sites not being maintained or updated; other inaccuracies are related to not understanding or misinterpreting information. The results of this study are consistent with others that also have found significant inaccuracies on health-related websites. 

Hold a brief discussion about why problems with accuracy of information can be important to consider.
