# Screen 7a (teacher only)

**Teacher only screen:** Show the green coffee bean extract study website to students again. Ask them to raise their hand if they wrote that seeing the words "clinical study" or "clinical trial" on the website is something that indicated accuracy (Step 3). Ask if they would react differently to those words now.

Inform students that scientists have continued to assess the paper that was published about the green coffee bean extract study. The scientists have found enough problems with the study that the authors have now retracted the paper. A paper is retracted when there are serious problems such as scientific misconduct, plagiarism, pervasive errors, or unsubstantiated data. If you wish, you can display the paper with a "RETRACTED" mark on it. You can explain that retraction is another way that scientists work to make sure results of studies are accurate. Click below to display the paper. 

**Retracted paper**

_The green coffee bean extract study was included in this lesson because it sometimes is more striking to point out what is bad than what is good (and probably more fun for students). However, only a small percentage of scientific papers are retracted each year (approximately four of every 10,000 papers). Some studies speculate that the number of retractions is increasing because papers are under more intense scrutiny now than they have been in the past._

If you wish, share the reading _Problems with the Green Coffee Bean Extract Study_ with students, which identifies specifically some of the problems with the study that led to its retraction. This may also help confirm some of the questions that students had when they read about the study. (You can decide whether your students would benefit from this additional information.)

**Problems with the Green Coffee Bean Extract Study**

If students question how they would really be able to tell whether a study was done well or not, you can confirm that this is a difficult issue. One thing people can do is look at the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Most people do not have time to search all the medical literature for answers. References provided on a product's website can also be checked (searched online) to see if there are any updates related to that product. Also, they can ask a health professional (doctor, nurse, pharmacist) for information. But perhaps one thing that everyone can do is develop a level of skepticism and be willing to raise questions. Have students heard the old expression, "Don't believe everything you see (or hear)?" Do they understand how it might apply in this situation?
