# **Lesson at a Glance**

### **_Lesson Overview_**
Students consider how to assess the accuracy of information retrieved from web searches related to health questions. They reflect on elements of good experimental design and learn how clinical trials are scientific experiments focused on learning about health issues. Students use what they have learned about clinical trials to evaluate two real clinical trials. Students then add criteria about accuracy to their rubrics and then test their rubrics by revisiting the CBD websites they viewed during Lesson 1 and evaluating them for information accuracy. 

### **_Major Concepts_**
- Internet searches to answer health questions retrieve a significant number of hits for websites that claim to be based on scientific evidence. 
- Websites vary in the accuracy of the information and the quality or evidence that they present.
- Well-designed clinical trials provide some of the best evidence for new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease.
- Clinical trials are scientific experiments that include people as participants. 
- Clinical trials follow specific protocols to help ensure they answer specific research questions and consider potential risks and benefits to participants. 
- Because people are the subjects, clinical trials must include information about participant's rights. 
- Peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals provide evidence to support claims about health- or science-related issues.

### **_Objectives_**
Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to 
- list basic elements of good experimental design,
- describe what a clinical trial is and its importance to health-related research,
- compare descriptions of different clinical trials and decide which provides stronger evidence to support its claims,
- give examples of what a person might see on a website page that would support accuracy of information on the website,
- develop a set of criteria related to accuracy to add to their rubrics, and
- apply the rubric to different sets of information and explain their scoring.
