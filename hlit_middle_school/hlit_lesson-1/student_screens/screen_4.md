# Step 4

During the lessons in this module, your task will be to develop a rubric that people can use to evaluate websites and the information presented on them. 

A **rubric** is a guide that can help you identify what is good, bad, or unclear about the information you find. The rubric lists criteria or evidence that can help people make better decisions.

In this lesson, you will start working with a rubric that can help people make decisions about websites they visit. In later lessons, you will add to the rubric and then test it before giving it to others to use.
