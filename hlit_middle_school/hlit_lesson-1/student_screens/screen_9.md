# Screen 9

Now that you have developed skills to assess website features, think back to the question about CBD that you considered at the start of this lesson: 

"Is CBD use to relieve pain supported by science and medicine?"

You will need 3 copies of the rubric-one for each of the CBD websites. Use the criteria on your rubric to score each of the CBD websites. 

Only do the first category, "Lesson 1 Website Quality Initial Screen," now. 

**Make sure you save all the rubrics.** You will need them again in later lessons. You may want to save them with your name and the name or number of the CBD website. For example, myname-CBD1. 

**Rubric**
<!--needs link(s)!-->

**CBD website 1        CBD website 2         CBD website 3**
<!--needs link(s)!-->

Keep the following ideas in mind: 

- Your scores do not need to match those of your teammates. The important part is that you can give a reason for your score. 
- You can change your score at any time if you think the evidence supports a change.
