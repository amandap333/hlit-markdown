# Step 4

In the lessons in this module, students will use a rubric. The rubric is a way to help students focus on evidence as a basis for making decisions. In this lesson, students are given the criteria for evaluating website features. In later lessons, students will be developing the criteria for their rubrics. 

Students are presented with the idea that they are developing a rubric to give to someone else to learn how to evaluate information found on websites. In the field test, students were more engaged in the rubric with this approach compared to developing it for their own use. (Students often thought they did not need to write things down, potentially due to thinking that they are already skilled internet users.) 

Have students access a copy of the rubric. This rubric includes the criteria that students will look for when they examine websites. Allow a few minutes for students to read over the criteria listed in the first section.
