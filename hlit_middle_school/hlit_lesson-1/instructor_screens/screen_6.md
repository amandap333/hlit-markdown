# Step 6

Have students work in teams of 3. (You may need one team of 2 or 4 depending on the number of students in your class.) If each student has a computer, each member of the team can choose 1 of the websites to examine. After each student finishes his or her website evaluation, the team can discuss and compare all three sites. If students are working in teams at one computer, they can go through all 3 of the websites together. In this case, each team member can take the lead on one copy of the rubric (for 1 site). 

This rubric includes 8 criteria that students will look for when they examine the websites. When students look at each website, they will see 8 icons [insert icon symbol] at various places on the page. Students should click on each icon to learn more about what that website feature can tell them about the quality of the site. Students then use that information to make a judgment about that feature on that particular website. 

Students can use the column, "Website feature and quality," on their rubrics to keep track of their findings. They can use plus signs or minus signs to indicate the strength or weakness of each website feature. 

If helpful, project one of the website pages and go through the process of clicking each icon, reading the information, and making a judgment about the feature as a class before having teams continue on their own.

**NOTE TO TEACHERS:** During the field test, a few teachers indicated that their students had already covered this information in other classes. However, it appeared that students still did not fully understand why these website features are important to consider. If your students have had similar instruction before, encourage them to use this as a review. They could also move through this activity at a faster pace than if it was new material. Also, explain to them that they will use this information in a new way to develop their rubric.
