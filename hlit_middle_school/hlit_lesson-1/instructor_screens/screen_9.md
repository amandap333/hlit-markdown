# Step 9

Now that students have learned about website features and have practiced using the rubric, they will go back to look at the 3 CBD websites. 

Allow time for students to score the sites using the rubric. At this stage, they are using only the category "Lesson 1 Website Quality Initial Screen." Students can work with their teammates to complete this step. 

Some students may try to infer things from the websites to justify higher scores. Encourage students to rely on evidence from the sites to make decisions. Also, encourage them to give specific reasons to justify the score they assign. For example, instead of saying that the site "does not include many of the criteria," have them write which criteria are not addressed or list reasons why the site scored well. 

**NOTE TO TEACHERS:** Students will continue using the rubric in later lessons. Make sure that students save the rubrics for the CBD sites electronically for later use.
