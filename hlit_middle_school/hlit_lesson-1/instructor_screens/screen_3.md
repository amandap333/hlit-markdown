# Step 3

The first part in this step serves as a transition to help students begin thinking about their previous experiences searching the internet. It is likely that students have been frustrated by confusing sites. They may or may not recognize that some sites are inaccurate. 

In later steps (and in the rest of the lessons in this module), students learn skills for analyzing information (including accuracy) they see on websites and other media sources. The information on this screen introduces them to the fact that many people have difficulty analyzing and understanding information they find on websites. This step is intended to have students start thinking about the importance of paying attention to website quality and the fact that this can be a difficult skill for many people.

Although your students may feel that they already know how to evaluate internet information, studies have shown that middle school and high school students are often easily duped. In one study, students had difficulty with even basic skills such as determining whether a website was a credible source or an ad.1
