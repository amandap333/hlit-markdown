# Step 7

Now that students have finished coding the features of each website, hold a class discussion to talk about or ask questions about the criteria on the rubric. If helpful, project a copy of the rubric during the discussion.

Continue by discussing how to assign a score on the rubric for this overall category of website quality and initial screening. The scoring on this rubric may be done differently than on other rubrics students have used. Points to bring out in the discussion include the following: 

- A site that meets all or most of the criteria on the rubric should get a higher score than a site that does not include many features or a site on which the features are not handled well.
- The score is for the entire category on the rubric (all 8 criteria). It should not be just a checklist to count the number of features. There could be situations in which a student decides that a specific criterium is not applicable to or important for their analysis. In that situation, this should not influence the score negatively. 
- Students do not need to agree with their teammates on a score. 
- It is important to be able to explain your score. The last column on the rubric includes space to write reasons for why a score is justified. 
- Scores can be changed if desired. If a student learns new information or interprets information in a different way, it is OK to change the score to reflect that new understanding.
