# Screen 5

5. Remind students that, starting in Lesson 1, their challenge was to develop a rubric that they could share with other people to help them learn how to analyze information. Explain that it is important to test their rubrics to meet this goal. 

Ask students to trade with a classmate the information item they evaluated as well as the question they used for evaluating their information item. You may want to have students trade with a student that they have not been working with previously during these lessons. Each student should use his or her own rubric to evaluate the information item and question from their classmate. 

After students use their rubrics to score their classmate's information item, they will discuss their results with their classmate. Students are likely to see how different people may judge information differently. Some people may put more emphasis on certain things than someone else does. This is a way for students to see that making decisions is not a simple thing and that, even when you have information to help guide you, it can be difficult to weigh all the factors that can affect individuals differently. Hearing the reasons why different students scored things differently may be revealing for students. This is not intended for students to decide who is right or to come to consensus on scores. 

If you wish, you can display the sample completed rubric (or hand out copies) for students to view and compare to the ones they developed. Respond to any student questions about what an entry means or why it might be included on the sample rubric. Students' rubrics do not need to match this one. This is included to give students some points to consider when thinking about their own rubrics. Their rubrics may have other points that are valid that but not included on the sample.
