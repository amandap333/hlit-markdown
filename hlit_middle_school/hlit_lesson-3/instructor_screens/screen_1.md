# Step 1

Ask students to work in teams of 2-3. In this step, teams think of an example of a website or advertisement that was trying to persuade the reader to buy or believe something. Teams brainstorm ways that the writers were trying to influence them. Encourage students to write ideas in their science notebook even if they are not sure about them. In general terms, students may think of things like high quality, good price, good cause, better than other similar products, or need for the product.
