# Step 7

Have students get their rubrics out. In this step, they will add criteria to the category "Lesson 3 Persuasion and Relevance". Students should feel free to discuss with their teammates. It is OK if students do not have as many criteria to list as there are spaces on the rubric. Some of the things that came up during the persuasion strategies activity may overlap with things that are already on their rubric from Lesson 2. Students can judge where to place things on the rubric or they may see differences that they feel justify inclusion on the rubric in more than one lesson.

If students are having difficulty writing criteria, hold a class discussion to share and help prompt ideas. A couple of statements that would be relevant examples include the following:

- The website or advertisement does not rely on questionable persuasion methods.
- The information presented relates directly to the claims made.
