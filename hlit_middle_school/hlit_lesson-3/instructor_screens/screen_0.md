# Screen 0 (teacher only)

**Teacher only screen:** Before students log onto the computer, have a quick class discussion about the question, "Why do people put health information on the internet?" 

This should take only a minute or two. Student answers will vary. Likely responses may include the following:

- To educate people about medical problems
- To promote good health
- To sell a health-related product or service
- To try to persuade people about a health-related issue

Students will start working on the computers in the next step.
