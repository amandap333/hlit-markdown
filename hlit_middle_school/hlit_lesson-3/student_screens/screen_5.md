# Screen 5

Sometimes you have to sort through a lot of information to separate the helpful and relevant information from the rest. Take another look at the lemonade diet cleanse website. 

Can you identify specific words, phrases, or statements that raise questions about the quality of the information? Are there phrases or statements that do not seem to support the claims made? 

Draw a table in your science notebook like the one below to record your ideas. An example is included to get you started. 

| Idea, phrase, or statement in ad | Question you want answered about that statement |
| ------ | ---------|
|   Heal your cells  |   What does it mean to heal cells, and how would that work?     |
|     |       |
|     |       |
|     |       |
|     |       |
|     |       |
|     |       |

When you are done, your teacher will lead a class discussion so you can share some of your ideas with the class. 

**Lemonade diet cleanse website**
<!--needs link(s)!-->
<!--The Lemonade Diet Cleanse Ad should be a link to a new page. The file, lemonade diet cleanse, is a version used in print. The info is good, but it can be designed to look better as a “fake” website. (more contemporary style). -->
