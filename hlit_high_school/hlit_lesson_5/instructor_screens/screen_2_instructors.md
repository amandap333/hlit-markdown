# Step Two

Ask students to get out the information item that they found themselves. Students should record their question and source in their science notebook. If students choose a printed piece, they could tape or staple it into their notebook. If the source is from the internet, they can write down the URL so they can return to it easily.

You may want to check the questions they wrote. The questions will be most useful if they have some specificity. For example, instead of the question, “Is this product good?,” a more refined question would be, “Is this product helpful for treating the condition it was intended for?” or “Is this a treatment that is likely to have more benefits than risks?”
