# Step Seven

In this step, students are introduced to the idea that accessing, evaluating, and understanding information is a central part of health literacy, science literacy, and media literacy. As another way to help students understand the relevance of this module to their lives, you could share some information about health literacy with students.

The lessons in this module do not cover all aspects of health literacy discussed in this file, but it should help students see how these skills apply to their lives. It may also be valuable to discuss with students how the ability to analyze information will become more valuable as they get older because they will be increasingly making decisions about their own health. After sharing the information about health literacy with students, ask them if they have any ideas about how they will use their new skills in their own lives. 

You may also want to extend the discussion to include the idea that this type of thinking may be valuable in other areas of their lives. Ask students what other kinds of decisions they may be making in the future that would benefit from analyzing the evidence for. Answers may range from trying to make sense of information in their classes, choosing a career or education pathway, house or apartment to live in, car to buy, or who to vote for.
