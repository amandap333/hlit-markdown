# Lesson at a Glance

### Lesson Overview
Students test the rubric they have developed to analyze health-related information of their own choosing. They then analyze information obtained by their peers to compare and discuss their ideas about the effectiveness of the rubric. Students develop questions they would want answered before purchasing or using the health-related product treatment that was the basis of their rubric analysis.

### Major Concepts
- A rubric provides guidance when analyzing information and making decisions.
- Rubrics can be modified to reflect new information.
- People often need to seek additional information when making decisions related to their health.
- Health literacy is the ability to obtain, analyze, and understand information to help people make better decisions about their health and well-being.


### Objectives
Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:
- use their rubric to analyze health-related information from the media;
- describe why a rubric can help make informed decisions;
- give examples to explain why different people may reach different conclusions about health-related claims when using a rubric;
- list ways to obtain additional information about a health-related claim, product, or treatment; and
- explain why people need to be careful when they see or hear health-related claims.


## In Advance

***Estimated time for the lesson:*** 2 45-minute class periods

***Screens to project:***

- Sample Completed Rubric (optional; step 5; could also be printed)
- How Is Health Literacy Important in Our Everyday Lives? (step 7)


### Materials
- copies of the rubrics that students have developed (1 for each media resource they are evaluating plus 1 copy for use when trading resources with a partner)
- copies of the rubrics students have been using to assess the CBD websites


### Preparation
- Read through and review information in this lesson.
- In preparation for this lesson (see Lesson 3 notations), students should have thought of a question they would like answered and have located at least one example of health-related information in preparation for this lesson. You should assign the number of resources that students will use (related to the same question). The lesson will go faster if students analyze one media item, but they may better see discrepancies and quality differences if they analyze two or three different items that relate to the same question. Students can find items (advertisement, article, and so forth) from a wide variety of sources, including the internet, social media, emails, magazines, television, newspapers, and so forth. Students should find a topic that interests them and an item of appropriate length. If the item is very short, there would not be much to evaluate. Students do not need to prescreen their information source for qualityâ€”they can choose an item just because something about it appeals to them. It can be more eye-opening if it turns out that some of the items are not too informative when scored using the rubric.
