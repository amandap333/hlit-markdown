# Step Three

Have students work in teams of 2–3 for this step, which gives them the chance to see if they can identify words or phrases on a website that relate to accuracy. Give students 5–10 minutes to list such words they see on the green coffee bean extract website that might suggest accurate or inaccurate information.

Ask for volunteers to share words or phrases that they thought suggested accurate or inaccurate information. Ask them to explain their reasons. Some teams may have different ideas, which is OK if their reasons align with their ideas.
