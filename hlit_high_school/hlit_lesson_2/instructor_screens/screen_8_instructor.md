# Step Eight

Have students retrieve the copies of the rubric that they started using in Lesson 1. Students can work with their team members to think about criteria to add to the “Lesson 2” category of the rubric based on what they learned about accuracy of information in this lesson. Students do not need to have an entry for all the boxes in the chart. If helpful, remind students to write their criteria in the form of a statement rather than a question and to phrase it in a way that the optimal answer would lead to a higher score.

The goal is for students to develop their own rubric and to start making decisions about what is important to include.

The rubric lists two criteria to help students get started. Potential entries on the rubric related to accuracy of information include the following:
- The information or claim is based on recent scientific studies.
- The treatment, medication, or intervention has been appropriately tested (through well-designed clinical trials).
- Information is provided about whom the intervention applies to (e.g., men, women, racial/ethnic groups, ages).
- Any conflict-of-interest or financial incentive is disclosed.

Students may find it challenging to write criteria on the rubric. If more appropriate for your students, you can write one or two criteria statements as a class exercise before having students work in teams. You may also want to remind students that they are developing this rubric as a tool to give to someone else who does not know how to evaluate a website.

Encourage students (both in this lesson and later) to view the rubric as something that is dynamic and can be changed later if they think of other things to add or decide that something should be revised
