# Step Four

To help students understand clinical trials in the upcoming steps, students think about what they know about experimental design. After students (working with a partner) have a few minutes to write some of their ideas about what is important when designing an experiment, hold a class discussion. As students share their ideas, record them on the board. Student responses may include:
- asking a question that is testable,
- using one or more comparison groups,
- controlling variables, and
- using adequate numbers of test subjects.

The list does not need to be complete at this time. Students may recognize other things as they read about clinical trials in the next step. Save this list to refer to later in the lesson.
