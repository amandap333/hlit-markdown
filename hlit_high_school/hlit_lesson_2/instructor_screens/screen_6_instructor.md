# Step Six

Have students work in teams of 2–3 for this part of the lesson.
- Have students work in teams of 2–3 for this part of the lesson.
- Give each student a copy of the handout, *Evaluating the Clinical Trials.*
- Instruct half the teams to read the green coffee bean extract study and the other half of the teams to read the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study.
- Explain that they should use what they learned from the reading to fill in the blanks on their handouts. (Tell students it is OK if they cannot fill in a blank because information is not included in their reading.)
- After teams have completed their readings, have them meet with a group that had the other study to compare their answers (and fill in the blanks on the handout for the other study).

If students are having trouble understanding the results of the studies, have them focus on information related more closely to the design of the studies. (However, some students may notice that some of the results of the green coffee bean extract study are unexpected, i.e., more weight loss during a washout period or during the placebo phase than during the low- or high-dose phases.)
