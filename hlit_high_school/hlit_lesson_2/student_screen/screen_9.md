# Step Nine

To conclude, return to the CBD websites you looked at in the first lesson.
- Reexamine each of the three websites.
- Use your rubric to score each website for accuracy of information.
- Be prepared to report how you scored the websites and to discuss the reasons for your scores.
- Consider the following questions:
  - Did your opinion change about the quality of each of the websites?
  - What are the strengths or weaknesses of each site with respect to the accuracy of information?
  - Do you think you will question the accuracy of information on websites differently in the future? How will that affect your use of the internet?
