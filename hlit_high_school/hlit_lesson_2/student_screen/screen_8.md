# Step Eight

In Lesson 1, you used a rubric to evaluate information about website features. Now, you will continue working with the rubric.

Get the rubrics you started in Lesson 1. Notice in the “Lesson 2” category that there are two entries in the rubric to get you started. What criteria do think should be added to the rubric? Work with 1–2 teammates to discuss ideas for other criteria that would be appropriate for this category. 

Think about what you learned from reading about clinical trials to help you. The handout Evaluating the Clinical Trials may also help.
