# Step Eight

There are fewer regulations for selling OTC medications, with less involvement of the FDA. This is somewhat similar to how rules for an OTC product commercial are less strict than for prescription medication commercials. This does not mean that OTC medications are not regulated at all. An OTC medication has to follow guidelines set for the type of product.

The FDA puts together a type of “recipe book” that gives the guidelines for different types of OTC medications that companies refer to for their product development. For example, a pain reliever that includes active ingredient X must contain an amount of ingredient X that is within a safe dosage range set for OTC pain relievers using that ingredient.
