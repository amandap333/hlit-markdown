# Step Two

Students watch and compare 2 TV commercials for medications. At this stage, students should be comparing the ads at a general level. The ads are for products with two very different purposes. The main thing students should notice is that the ad for the prescription drug (StelaraÂ®) includes information about the desired outcomes of using the drug and the potential for negative outcomes. The other ad, for an over-the-counter medication, provides much less information and focuses on the positive outcomes the user might experience.

At this point, students do not need to identify specific ideas or phrases in the ads that relate to positive or negative outcomes. They do not need to know specific information about the conditions mentioned in the ads or what the drugs do. They should simply compare the two ads and notice that one includes much more information than the other.
