# Step six

In this step, students learn that ads for prescription medications are regulated by the FDA and that companies must include a balance of benefits and risks in their advertisements for these medications. The goal of this exercise is not necessarily for students to memorize all the required elements of an advertisement for a medication but rather to learn what to look for in an ad and to recognize that different types of medications have different requirements. Students may also start looking at ads more critically to recognize how advertisers portray products.

***Optional:*** If you wish, you can show the following FDA web page to students: “Incorrect Product Claim Ad”.
