# Step Five

Students should identify 3 benefits and 3 risks identified in the Stelara® commercial. Some of the benefits may be worded in ways that imply a generally more healthy, positive outcome (for example, being able to wear a dress that exposes your skin) rather than in medical terms. Encourage students to talk with 1–2 other students as they do this.

The goal is to help students see that an ad for a prescription medication cannot be slanted to focus only on benefits (this will come out later in the lesson). Click on the text below to see a sample analysis of benefits and risks from the commercial.
