# Step Fourteen

Have students get their rubrics that they have been working with. Their goal is to add criteria to the rubric that relate to benefits and risks. Encourage them to think about what they learned in the lesson and to discuss their ideas with their teammates.

If students need help getting started, you can remind them that they learned about benefits. Prompt them to write a statement along the lines of “The information clearly describes the benefits of the product or treatment.” 

Students will also revisit the CBD websites and use their rubrics to score those sites for benefits and risks.
