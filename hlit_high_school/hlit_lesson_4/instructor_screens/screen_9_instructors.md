Dietary supplements are another class of product. Students may be surprised to learn that these products are not regulated by the FDA before they go on the market. A common misconception is that products that are “natural,” such as herbal remedies, are always safe. There have been cases where a natural product can cause problems such as bleeding or interfering with anesthesia during surgeries. It can also be a problem knowing how much of an ingredient is in a product. Several years ago, St. John’s wort was being promoted to alleviate mild depression. However, it is difficult to know how much of the substance was actually in the pills. There have also been cases none of the ingredient present in the supplement. (This has been found to be the case with some CBD supplements.) People should discuss the use of dietary supplements with their health care professional.
