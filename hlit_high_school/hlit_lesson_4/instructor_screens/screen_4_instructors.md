# Step Four

Students are introduced to the concepts of benefit and risk on this screen. Most students will not have much trouble understanding the idea of benefits. The idea of risk may be a bit more challenging for students. A common misconception is that risk implies that the negative consequence will occur rather than it just being more likely. Other students may think that risks are only a problem if there is something already “wrong” with a person. Students will continue to think about risk and benefit during the remainder of the lesson.
