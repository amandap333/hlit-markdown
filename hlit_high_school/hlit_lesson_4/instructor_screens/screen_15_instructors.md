# Step Fifteen

After students have time to write statements in their rubrics, hold a class discussion so they can share their ideas. The following are some ideas that students can include on their rubrics.
- The benefits of the treatment, medication, or intervention are clearly explained.
- Information about potential risks (and the probability of these risks) is provided.
- The information being analyzed includes information about potential costs (e.g., monetary, time) that may be associated with the intervention.
- The information specifies how a given intervention, treatment, or medication compares with other possible interventions.

**Optional:** If desired, hold a class discussion or debate about the following scenario:
> It is now common to see ads for prescription medications on TV, in magazines, or on the internet. Before the early 1980s, companies could not advertise these medications directly to the public. The United States and New Zealand are currently the only countries in the world that allow this type of advertising. Should companies be allowed to advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers? What are the benefits and risks related to this advertising?
