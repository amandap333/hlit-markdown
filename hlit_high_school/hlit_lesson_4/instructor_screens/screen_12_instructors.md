# Step Twelve

This screen asks students to summarize what they have learned about the different types of products. The table below gives sample answers for how students might rank the different products for the different categories.


| |Prescription medicine | Over-the-counter medicine | Dietary supplement |
| --- |--- | --- | ---|
| Regulations | 1 | 2  | 3 |
| Scientific evidence | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|Potential risks | 3 | 2  | 1 |


Students may rank the potential risks a bit differently, which is OK if their justifications match their rankings. Dietary supplements could rank as the highest risk because they (usually) have the least amount of evidence supporting the claims, or they could be ranked lower because they (usually) have less effect on the body (depending on the situation). Prescription medications could be said to have the lowest potential risk because of the amount of evidence accumulated before they are put on the market and because they are used under the supervision of a doctor. However, you could argue that they could have a higher risk if they were used inappropriately.
