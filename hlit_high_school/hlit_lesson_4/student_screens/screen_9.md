There is another type of product sold in stores. These are called supplements. Supplements are defined as products taken by mouth that contain a “dietary ingredient.” Dietary ingredients are things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, plant products, or other substances. Supplements can come in many forms, such as pills, tablets, capsules, powders, energy bars, or liquids. Supplements are sold in stores and through the internet.

Some supplements may help people, but, like other products, there can be risks. There are times when supplements can be harmful to some people. Sometimes, people think that because a product is natural, it is safe. Even supplements derived from plants can have an unwanted side effect if used improperly.  

The FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before they are marketed. The companies that make the supplements should make sure they are safe and made in a quality manner. The FDA can step in if it is found that a supplement puts people at risk or if it is not what it claims to be.
