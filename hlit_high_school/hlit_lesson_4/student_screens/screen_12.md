# Step Twelve

In this lesson, you have learned about prescription drugs, OTC drugs, and dietary supplements.

Draw a chart like the following in your science notebook.




|&nbsp;|Prescription medicine|Over-the-counter medicine|Dietary|
| ---| ---| ---|---|
| supplement | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;  |
| Regulations | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Scientific evidence | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Potential risks | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp; |


Rank each type of product for each category. For example, which product (prescription medicine, OTC medicine, or dietary supplement) is most highly regulated? Give that product a 1. Give the product that is least regulated a 3. Give the remaining product a 2.

Continue for the other categories using a 1 for the highest level and 3 for the lowest. Be prepared to explain your rankings.
