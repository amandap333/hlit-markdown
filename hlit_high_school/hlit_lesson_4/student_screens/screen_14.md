# Step Fourteen

This lesson focused on thinking about risks and benefits when making decisions about health issues.

Pull up the rubrics you have been working on. At this point, you will add new criteria to your rubric focusing on these ideas. What would you add to a rubric about risks and benefits to help you make decisions about health? 

Talk with your teammates about what statements to add to your rubric. Think back to what you did in this lesson to help you. For example, you started the lesson by looking at a commercial for a prescription medicine. You saw that the commercial included both risks and benefits. How would you write that as a statement for your rubric? 

After you have finished adding criteria to your rubric, look again at the CBD websites and use your new rubric section about risk and benefits to score those sites.
