# Step Ten

What can people do if they have concerns about an OTC medication or a dietary supplement? They can contact the FDA or another agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The FTC can file complaints or charges against marketing companies that make invalid claims in ads.  

The FTC has rules for ads for these products. They include the following: 
- Ads must be truthful.
- Ads must have evidence to back up their claims.

The amount of evidence can depend on the claim made. At a minimum, the company must have the evidence it claims to have. For example, a company cannot say that “2 out of 3 doctors recommend ABC pain reliever” if they have not done a reliable survey to get this result. In other cases, companies should have scientific tests or studies that have been reviewed by appropriate experts.
