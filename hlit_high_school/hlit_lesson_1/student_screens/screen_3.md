# Step Three

People can spend a lot of time looking at websites. Often, information on one website is different from information on another website. After looking at a site, have you ever felt like you wasted your time because you did not find what you were looking for? Have you spent a long time looking at a site before figuring out that the information is confusing or wrong? How did it affect you getting the information you wanted?

People get a lot of information about their health from the internet. This information can be hard to make sense of. Understanding the information can be even harder if a website is of poor quality. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9 out of 10 adults have trouble understanding health information1. The problem is worse when:
- the topic is new to them,
- the topic is new to them,
- there is a lot of jargon. (Jargon is special words or phrases used by specific professions that most people do not know.)

If people do not understand the information, they may make poor decisions.
