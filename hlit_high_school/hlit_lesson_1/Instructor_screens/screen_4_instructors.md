# Step Four

Students are presented with the idea that they are developing a rubric to give to someone else to learn how to evaluate information found on websites. In the field test, students were more engaged in the rubric with this approach compared to developing it for their own use. (Students often thought they did not need to write things down, potentially due to thinking that they are already skilled internet users.)

Have students access a copy of the rubric. (See the Materials list.) This rubric includes several criteria that students will look for when they examine websites. (Students will also be adding criteria to their rubrics in later steps.) Allow a few minutes for students to read over the criteria listed in the first section.
