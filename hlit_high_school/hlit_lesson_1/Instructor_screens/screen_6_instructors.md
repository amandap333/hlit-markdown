# Step Six

This rubric includes 5 criteria that students will look for when they examine the websites. When students look at each website, they will see 8 icons **[insert icon symbol]** at various places on the page. Students should click on each icon to learn more about what that website feature can tell them about the quality of the site. Students then use that information to make a judgment about that feature on that particular website. Students will color-code each feature and record information on their rubric.

If helpful, you could project one of the website pages and go through the process of clicking each icon, reading the information, and making a judgment about the feature as a class before having teams continue on their own.

Students should be able to match 5 of the icons to entries on the rubric. They should write statements on the rubric for the 3 icons representing criteria that are missing from the rubric. Encourage students to work together to come up with statements to add to the rubric.

**NOTE TO TEACHERS:** During the field test, a few teachers indicated that their students had already covered this information in other classes. However, it appeared that students still did not fully understand why these website features are important to consider. If your students have had similar instruction before, encourage them to use this as a review. They could also move through this activity at a faster pace than if it was new material. Also, explain to them that they will use this information in a new way to develop their rubric.
