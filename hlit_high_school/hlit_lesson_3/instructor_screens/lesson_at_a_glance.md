# **Lesson at a Glance**

### **_Lesson Overview_**
In this lesson, students consider the motivations that cause people to post health information online. Students learn some different persuasion strategies that marketers use to influence consumers. Students work in small teams to compose a role-play highlighting one of the strategies intended to further a particular agenda. Students then learn about and practice critical thinking by developing questions about information on a website.

### **_Major Concepts_**
- People or companies have different motivations when conveying health information.
- Creators of health information resources use different strategies (such as stirring up emotions, making claim about quality of research supporting claims, causing fear, and so forth) to persuade others about the accuracy or quality of their materials.
- People seeking health information should be aware of potential bias in the resources they find.
- Critical thinking is a skill that allows people to make logical and informed decisions to the best of their abilities. It involves analyzing an issue or situation using facts, data, and evidenceâ€”and not opinions or feelings.
- People have the right to question information presented in the media.

### **_Objectives_**
Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to
- discuss different motivations used when health information is presented online or in other media,
- recognize some of the most common strategies used to persuade others, and
- ask questions about the quality or relevance of information presented in (or missing from) the media (e.g., an ad).
