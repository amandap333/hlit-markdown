# Step Six

This screen provides students with some additional information about the value of critical thinking skills. You might ask students if they can think of an example from their own lives when they used critical thinking skills. If appropriate, you may want to hold a discussion with students about how they can obtain more information to resolve questions they may have. For example, students could do internet research, talk with health professionals (such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists), or perhaps even look into primary research papers in which the original research was reported. This could also be a time to discuss how being skeptical of what you see or hear can be beneficial. Again, it does not mean require being confrontational, but asking questions and asking for evidence or clarification is something people should be comfortable doing.

You could, if you wish, also extend this discussion to include the idea that some people are uncomfortable questioning an “expert.” Ask students whether people should question experts and expect answers that are understandable (i.e., in language that is appropriate for everyone and not just understandable by other experts in the field). This “intimidation” is not uncommon in the medical field. Medical professionals should be able to explain issues in common language, and patients have the right to expect these types of explanations—and to keep asking questions until they understand the information.
