# Step Four

Students are provided a definition of critical thinking and some questions that are indicative of critical thinking. A misconception is that critical thinking is being critical of others or being argumentative. If students mention this, help clarify that being critical is about finding evidence to support decision making. Critical thinking is an open-minded effort to answer a question or test a hypothesis by combining good evidence with good ideas. People who exhibit good critical thinking skills generally:
- are open to new ideas,
- persist and have staying power in thinking through a problem,
- can appreciate others’ viewpoints,
- are not afraid to take an unpopular stand,
- do not accept everything at face value, and
- are flexible and willing to change tactics.

The article that students read in this step is intended to demonstrate some of these critical thinking skills. It is not important that students remember the specific questions that are asked, but they should recognize that two of the doctors in the story are using critical thinking skills to question information about juice cleanses. For example, near the beginning of the article, Dr. Grendell says that he has asked people what they are trying to get rid of with a cleanse. Later in the article, Dr. Saddler brings up the questions, “Why does the stomach need resting?” and “Who said that [cleansing] was beneficial?”

If helpful for your students, you could project the article for the class and read part of the article aloud while students try to find examples of critical thinking. After a few examples, students can continue independently.
