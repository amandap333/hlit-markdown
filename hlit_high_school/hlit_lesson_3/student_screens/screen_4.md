It can be hard to tell from an ad whether the information is accurate or if the persuasion strategies are potentially misleading.

One way that people can try to make sense of information is by practicing critical thinking. 

**Critical thinking** is a skill that allows you to make logical and informed decisions to the best of your ability. It involves analyzing an issue or situation using facts, data, and evidence—and not opinions or feelings.

People who are using their critical thinking skills question the information they read. They may ask questions such as these:
- What did they say?
- Who said it?
- Why are they telling me this?
- Where did they say it?
- When did they say it?
- How did they say it?
- Do their words support their main idea?
